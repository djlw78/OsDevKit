# OsDevKit
OSDevKit is a simplified, yet powerful OS development IDE. It supports ASM, C, C++ and Free basic source files, with plenty of templates in each supported language to give you a jump start in OS development, all compilers are cross compatible so you can even mix all the supported language in one os.

# Installation
The safest way to install is to download the **.zip** archive from the GitHub Releases page and unzip it onto your hard drive. This will give you that latest tested version, you can run the OsDevKit.exe. If you would like to experiment with the live source, simply clone the master branch to your local computer. Once you have obtained the source using your perferred method, open **./Src/OsDevKit/OsDevKit.sln** using Visual Studio (Any version except Web or Shell). Then compile and run it. If in the future you would like to run the software again without re-building it, launch it from **./Src/OsDevKit/bin/**PROFILE**/OsDevKit.exe**.
